# <h1 align="center">LOMUCHACHOgames - Games Web Store</h1>

Hiüëã, I'm Valentino Traverso developer of LOMUCHACHOgames. This is the first project that i create, it based on PHP. <br>
I worked in LOMUCHACHOgames for about 2 or 3 years, this was a website wich more than 2.500 users per day only in the spanish version. Now a day it's not available but i want to share the source code. <br>

## ü§î What is LOMUCHACHOgames?

It's a app store web application, created by me and a partner. The main idea of the project was to give the users the capability to share APK's for Android with all the comunnity. <br>
Then we starting growing up and we decide to expand in other types of store like desktop app or a book store.<br>
The app was developed in different languages like portuguese and english, but the spanish community was the bigger that we had.

## Develop

This project have differents styles of code because when i was creating and learning too, so you could see how the code is getting "better".<br>
We used PHP as main language, because in that moment it was much better than others for this kind of project. It facilitated the connection to the database and gave us the possibility to make a strong CRUD.
