# LOMUCHACHOgames - Games Web Store

Hi👋, I'm Valentino Traverso developer of LOMUCHACHOgames. This is the first project that i create, it based on PHP. <br>
I worked in LOMUCHACHOgames for about 2 or 3 years, this was a website wich more than 2.500 users per day. Now a day it's not available but i want to share the source code. <br>

## 🤔 What is LOMUCHACHOgames?

It's a app store web application, created by me and a partner. The main idea of the project was to give the users the capability to share APK's for Android with all the comunnity. <br>
Then we starting growing up and we decide to expand in other types of store like desktop app or a book store.
